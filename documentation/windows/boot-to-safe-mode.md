## Introduction

BitLocker drives only lock the OS volume, leaving the system partition accessible. This allows technicians to modify boot configuration through WinPE to enable network safe boot mode for troubleshooting and recovery purposes.

## Method: Network Safe Boot via WinPE

### Steps

1. **Boot to WinPE Environment**
  - Insert WinPE bootable media
  - Boot the target computer from the WinPE media
  - Wait for WinPE to fully load

2. **Assign Drive Letter to System Partition**
  - Open Command Prompt in WinPE
  - Use `diskpart` to identify and assign a drive letter to the system partition
  - Note the assigned drive letter (referenced as `{letter}` below)

3. **Navigate to Boot Configuration**
  - Navigate to the boot configuration directory:
    ```
    {letter}:\EFI\Microsoft\Boot
    ```

4. **Modify Boot Configuration**
  - Execute the bcdedit command to enable network safe boot:
    ```
    bcdedit /store C:\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\BCD /set {default} safeboot network
    ```

5. **Reboot System**
  - Remove WinPE media
  - Restart the computer
  - System will boot into network safe mode

## Notes

- Always ensure proper backup procedures before modifying boot configuration
- To disable safe boot mode, use: `bcdedit /deletevalue {default} safeboot`

## Use Cases

- System recovery when BitLocker is preventing normal boot
- Network troubleshooting in encrypted environments
- Remote assistance scenarios requiring network access
- Maintenance tasks requiring safe mode with networking
